# Explainable AI
This repository contains my thesis project, created between Oct. 2020 and Oct.2021. 
It is a web application able to create analysis to find and visualize anomalous behaviours in AI agents.  
Specifically, it implements namely XPOMCP published in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12732.  
The web application has been written in React (Gatsby) as frontend, and using FastAPI in python for the backend.  
The frontend can be found in: https://github.com/gbagolin/explainable-ai-gatsby-version   
While the backend can be found in: https://github.com/gbagolin/explainableai-backend   
This repository contains also the presentation of the dissertation, which is a summary of my work if you are interested. 

A video is present down here to present how the web application works:
